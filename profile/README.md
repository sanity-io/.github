Sanity is a [Content Operating System][intro] that turns content into structured, reusable data. We give developers complete control over how content is modeled, managed, and delivered.

- **[Real-time][realtime]**: Live queries, collaborative editing, instant previews built-in
- **[Customizable][studio-custom]**: React-based Studio you can customize completely, plus [App SDK][app-sdk] for organization-wide applications
- **Framework agnostic**: Works with Next.js, Remix, Astro, or any framework
- **[AI-ready][app-sdk]**: Structured content with rich context that AI can use effectively

### Schema-as-code

```typescript
// schemaTypes/articleType.ts
import { defineType, defineField } from "sanity";

export const articleType = defineType({
  name: "article",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    defineField({
      name: "title",
      type: "string",
      validation: (Rule) => [
        Rule.required(),
        Rule.max(80).warning(
          "Titles over 80 characters may be truncated in search results"
        ),
      ],
    }),
    defineField({
      name: "excerpt",
      type: "text",
      validation: (Rule) =>
        Rule.custom((value, context) => {
          // Cross-field validation
          const isFeatured = context.document?.featured;
          return isFeatured && !value
            ? "Featured articles need an excerpt"
            : true;
        }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

### GROQ query language

```typescript
import { defineQuery } from "groq";

export const ARTICLES_QUERY = defineQuery(`*[_type == "article"] {
  _id,
  title,
  "author": author->name,
  "categories": categories[]->title,
  "wordCount": length(pt::text(body))
}[0...10]`);
```

[GraphQL][graphql] is also available if you prefer it.
